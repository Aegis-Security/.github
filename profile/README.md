# Aegis Security ðŸ›¡
Are you ever concerned with how your security software functions, such as your antivirus or ad blocker? Perhaps it may record what you're doing on the internet, or say
it's removing malware but not actually doing anything. Our goal as a security organisation is to eliminate that concern.

At Aegis, we create free and open-source security software, which means it's free (woo!) and you can view the inner workings of our programs and what we do with content
on your computer.

## What do we create?
### For everyone, we create...
- Aegis Antivirus, our FOSS[^1] antivirus software
- Aegis Block, our FOSS content blocker (ad block)
- Aegis Firewall, our FOSS firewall software

### For developers, we create...
- Aegis Definitions, our open-source virus definitions
- Aegis Filter, our open-source ad filter list

[^1]: FOSS stands for "Free and Open-Source"
